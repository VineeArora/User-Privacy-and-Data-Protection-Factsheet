## Factsheet - User Privacy and Data Protection

Are you new to Germany or the EU and interested in learning about your privacy rights?

As an expat in Germany with a background in marketing, I understand the importance of knowing your rights and those of your audience, particularly when it comes to privacy and data protection. After conducting extensive research on GDPR, I have created a factsheet that summarizes the basic privacy and data protection rights you must know if you are living in Germany. 

Please note that the information presented in this document is for informational purposes only and should not be considered legal advice. As the author is not a licensed attorney, no liability can be assumed for any actions taken or not taken based on this information. If you have any questions or concerns regarding GDPR compliance, we highly recommend seeking legal guidance from a licensed professional.
